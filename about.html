            <p>
                As a 400-level Systems Engineering student, my focus has been on both hardware and software efficiency. With two diplomas in Computer Science and Frontend Development, I have built on my passion for creativity and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to transform complex ideas into beautiful digital solutions.

            <p>
                My area of low confidence is in using visual and color styling consistency across large projects. I am working to perfect my understanding of UI design systems and high-contrast color palettes, especially when styling using frameworks.

                Dear Future Self... A day will come where you will have all the time in the world to yourself. You can never finish learning so don't stop and don't get too too overwhelmed. Also, don't restrict yourself to frontend... try backend too.
